# DataCleaning
This project demonstrates a practical approach to data cleaning in Python using pandas and NumPy. The goal of the project is to take a messy dataset in CSV format, identify common data quality issues, clean them systematically, and finally export the cleaned data into an Excel file for further analysis or reporting.
